A C++ Console Program that calculates some in games stats after a certain time.

## Goals
- This Programs goal is to simulate Maplestory's Battle Analysis but in Maplestory v176
  - It uses pointers and offsets to read the client's in game stats and after a certain time interval calculates how much mesos and nx you'd make in an hour.
- Intended use is for v176 Private Servers, but might add more memory addresses for different versions.
